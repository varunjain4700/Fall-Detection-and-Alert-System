# Fall Detection and Alert System
Built a prototype of a system which detects fall of elderly people and notifies their family members with the location coordinates and pulse rate.
<h2>Problem</h2>-
Fall is the most significant cause of injury for elderly people. According to studies, most elderly people (over 75 years old) have fallen at least once a year, and 24 % of them have severe injuries. This is a serious public health problem with a substantial impact on health and healthcare costs. The cost and burden of caring for older adults is steadily increasing. Among people affected by Alzheimer’s disease, the probability of a fall increases by three times.

<h2>Solution</h2>-
In order to reduce the risk of elderly people getting harm from fall, medical attention needs to be provided immediately. Therefore, we have decided to build a smart and reliable fall detection system which can help to detect fall and alert their family member/nearest healthcare service in case of emergency for help and support.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>There's still a lack of awareness about the fall detection technology especially in the developing countries. Hence we have decided to make such a device that is affordable as well as comfortable to wear.
‘Divergence’ has acted as an enabler for the idea of our system.</li>
<li>This system uses an accelerometer and a gyroscope sensor to detect a person's fall and warns the surroundings with the help of a buzzer.</li>
<li>This system uses edge as well as cloud computing to create an IoT-enabled environment that delivers SMS, and location information to emergency contacts via Manet.</li>
<li>The system also incorporates a pulse sensor to detect chances of a fall if the value is in the critical region.</li>
<li>The system is user-friendly, cost-effective and durable.</li>
</ul>
